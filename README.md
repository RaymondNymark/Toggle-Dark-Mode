# Toggle-Dark-Mode
Toggle-Dark-Mode is a Windows 10 application that moves the default switching between dark and light theme down to the system tray.  You get an icon you can click to switch between the themes quicker than before. 🙂

This App is built using WPF, and the [Hardcodet.NotifyIcon.Wpf](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hardcodet.NotifyIcon.Wpf/ "Hardcodet.NotifyIcon.Wpf") nuget package to be able to use the Windows tray.

## Features
- System tray icon you can left click switch between Dark and Light system-wide themes!
- Button to run this application on startup.
- Scheduling options to automatically switch between themes at certain times during the day (Coming soon..!)

Requirements:
- Windows 10 or higher.
